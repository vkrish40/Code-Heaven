# Code-Heaven
Solutions to variety of coding problems.
Some of my leetcode solutions. Unfortunately, I haven't commented my code, so it would be difficult to make sense of the code at times. 
Word Ladder 2 solution isn't optimized, it would lead to rumtime error. It's a pretty challenging problem. I pretty much focused on the approach.
Minimum Window Substring code passes 267/268 test cases. There are two approaches which I've used to solve it. One approach yields a runtime error when running 268th test case whereas the other approach shows incorrect answer when running the same 268th test case which is weird. I didn't spend much time doing analysis on that since my objective was to understand the approach that we need to use in order to solve such a problem.

Note: A lot of time there are few test cases which are really complex and are hard to pass mainly due to time constraint.
